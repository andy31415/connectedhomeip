This folder contains a "uses codegen directly" implementation of the cluster.
It does not have stand-alone files and must be built as part of a code-generated
datamodel monolith library.

It directly makes use of application-specific generated code.

The file `contents.json` contains the list of files that should
be included as part of the build when compiling this cluster as part of the
compilation monolith.
